                <p class="lead">
                    The Bookclub application is designed to help readers discover, track,
                    and share their favorite books in one convenient place.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each month, we curate a list of featured titles across multiple genres,
                    from timeless classics to today’s most talked-about releases. Whether
                    you are a casual reader or a devoted book lover, our goal is to make it
                    easier for you to decide what to read next and stay engaged with the
                    community.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Behind the scenes, this site is also a learning project that demonstrates
                    how Spring Boot and Thymeleaf can be used together to build modern,
                    template-driven web applications. As new features are added, the Bookclub
                    app will continue to evolve into a more dynamic and interactive experience.
                </p>

                <p class="text-muted">
                    Thank you for visiting our Bookclub. We hope this application inspires
                    you to keep reading and sharing stories with others.
